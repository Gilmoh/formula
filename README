ToDo:
- Adjust maven pom:
    - adjust groupId by adding your sub group at the end (i.e. formula)
    - adjust artifactId by giving it a name (i.e. core)
    - adjust properties if you don't intend to use java (1.)8
    - check and adjust versions if needed or wanted

- Adjust the files in .github if you don't use main as your default branch (i.e. rename main to your default branch name)
- Create your package in the src/main/kotlin folder and delete the empty placeholder file
- Create your package in the src/test/kotlin folder and delete the empty placeholder file
- Get going
